# Netflix_sql-project


In this SQL-based Netflix project, we analyzed various datasets related to movies and TV shows available on the Netflix platform. By using SQL queries, we successfully extracted meaningful insights such as the total number of titles by country, genre distribution, year-wise release trends, and the comparison between movies and TV shows.

This project demonstrated the importance of data analysis in understanding user preferences and content trends. SQL proved to be a powerful tool for filtering, grouping, and aggregating data to derive valuable business insights.

Overall, the project enhanced our skills in data cleaning, querying, and analytical thinking â€” providing a strong foundation for working with real-world data and drawing actionable conclusions that can support decision-making in the entertainment industry.
